# RodriguezMAdd2NumbersEndpoint
#Open Postman, run debug in vs code, copy paste url from debug console in vs code: ie. https://localhost:7021. After you do that, add /endpoint/add to the end, and then one number with a slash before it, and then another number with a slash before it. Press send and the console should output the sum!
